This repo conducts battles between an agent controlling prey and an agent controlling multiple hunters.
The battle is conducted in a maze. 

Add your agent to the competitive_agents file. This requires only writing an update function. 
Look in examples.py for examples. 

To test your agents in a maze change the first couple lines of ui.py, as indicated by the comments. 
Run ui.py (python ui.py) and press 'b'. Your final score is printed to the console.  You can also update the maze by clicking lines. Clicking a line will add or remove an edge depending on if an edge is already at the line you clicked.
